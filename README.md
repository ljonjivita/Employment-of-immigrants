# Employment-of-immigrants

This is a page showing the employment of immigrants in counties in Norway.
The map shown is intended as a prototype for a larger project, which visualizes both municipalities and county employment,
and compares employment of the entire population with immigrants from regions around the world.

Made for an assignment at school, so it includes some theory about vector tiles.
